AVR ATmega168 with ENC28J60 Ethernet
====================================

Overview
--------

This is a pretty old project with a basic PCB consisting of an atmega168, enc28j60, voltage regulator and the physical connectors.
I've successfully used to board to transmit basic Ethernet packets.


Warning
-------

The current status of this repository is very unstable and the committed code is likely to be part of testing, so don't take it too seriously ;)

Known Bugs
----------

Some of the Ethernet pins need to be patched since they wired wrongly. This is likely to be fixed when I order a proper PCB, someday.
